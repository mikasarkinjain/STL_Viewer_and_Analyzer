STL Viewer & Analyzer Development Log
======================

Mika Sarkin Jain & Ida Huang (Team Double A)
*For a more precise development history go to https://github.com/mikasarkinjain/STL_Viewer_and_Analyzer/graphs.

--Jan 12 2014--
Mika: Outlined entire project in detail, made a UML-esque diagram created Coordinate, Triangle, and 3DObject classes.
Ida: Worked on Coordinate, Triangle, and 3DObject class, made the constructor, toString, and getProjected methods.

--Jan 13 2014--
Mika: Made critical improvements to functionality of the Coordinate class. Created and worked on FileData class and GUI class.
Ida: Worked on the constructors for the Coordinate, Triangle, and 3DObject class. 

--Jan 14 2014--
Mika: Continued working on GUI, improved string parsing in FileData, looked over Ida's work and made corrections.
Ida: Robustified constructor of the Coordinate, Triangle, and 3DObject class. Fixed toString methods. Renamed 3DObject class to ThreeDObject because I could not create an object with numeral in its name. Imported java.util package for ArrayLists to classes in order to compile certain classes. Removed params (theta) in getProjected methods of the three classes in order to run the driver. Created the TestDriver class to test the Coordinate, Triangle, and ThreeDObject class. Found an error in compiling the FileData class. 

--Jan 15 2014--
Mika: Added projection math to the getProjectedCoord method of the Coordinate class. Renamed ThreeDObject to TriangleObject. Fixed a bug found in FileData class. 
Ida: Added parameters back into getProjected methods of Triangle, TriangleObject, and TestDriver after projection math was added. Updated TestDriver to also test FileData class. Fixed errors in the getFileData method. 

--Jan 16 2014--
Mika: Added more functionality to GUI class and added file reading capabilitied to FileData.
Ida: Worked on bugs found in the FileData class. Fixed errors in GUI.

--Jan 17 2014--
Mika: Fixed bugs in Coordinate class. Added functionality to GUI.
Ida: Created maxCor and minCor methods in the Triangle class, and getMax and getMin methods in TriangleObject class. Updated the TestDriver class to test getMin and getMax methods. Fixed issues found with the getFileData method in FileData. 

--Jan 18 2014--
Mika: Finished GUI, improved projection math, fixed bugs in Coordinate class, created website. 
Ida: Finished getMax and getMin in Triangle and TriangleObject class. 

--Jan 19 2014--
Mika: Improved website. 
Ida: Nothing.

--Jan 20 2014--
Mika: Changed website.
Ida: Nothing.

--Jan 21 2014--
Mika: Revised log and commented code, improved projection math.
Ida: Revised log and commented code.

--Jan 22 2014--
Mika: Revised log and commented code, worked on website.
Ida: Revised log and commented code.

--Jan 23 2014--
Mika: Revised log and commented code, improved website, improved readme.md.
Ida: Revised log and commented code.

--Reflection--

Obstacles Overcome (and how)
  GUI refreshing obstacle overcome by figuring out how to access the graphics object of JFrame
  File reading ability was researched
  Projection math derived from scratch
  File parsing solved with trial and error (pinpointing the location of error using S.O.P.)
  Rendering of lines solved with research

Unresolved Issues & Additional features
  Face rendering
  Shading
  Panning ability
  
Cool Stuff Learned (conceptual and/or practical)
  Better understanding distinct uses for ArrayLists and arrays
  Introduced to new methods in the String class
  How to make a GUI (and refresh it)
  How to read files
  Reinforced understanding of 3D projections onto the plane
  
Mid-development Design Changes (and why)
  No mouse interaction with projection besides with buttons - could not refresh fast enough (math takes too long to complete)
  No shading - could not fully derive math.
  No face rendering - could not fully derive math. 
  
Lessons Learned (to apply to future projects, CS or otherwise)
  Diagram and plan all aspects of the project in detail beforehand
  Budget time effectively and leave contingency time 
  Usefullness of S.O.P. to find errors in code
  How to effectively use GitHub on projects/ collaborated assignments
  Make something interesting 
  Do something enjoyable 
  Teamwork
